The Free-range Resonant Electrical Energy Delivery (FREE-D) wireless power system uses magnetically coupled resonators to efficiently transfer power across meter distances to an artificial heart, specifically a ventricular assist device (VAD) implanted in the human body.  Previously, artificial heart pumps recieved power from a wire through the chest, limiting patient quality of life. In fact nearly 75% of the LVAD patient population experiences Exit Site Infection (ESI) within the first 6 months of implantation. The FREE-D system will cut down on cardiac patients‚Äô dangerous infections and improve quality of life.</p>

WREL enables transfer of large amounts of power (up to 50W) over medium distances (1m, depending on coil size). Our key contribution is the development of adaptive tuning techniques that enable high efficiency power transfer, even as transmit-receive range, orientation, or load vary. WIth most wireless power systems, the further the receiver is from the transmitter, the less power can be transferred. The WREL system has a ‚Äúmagic regime‚Äù in which efficiency does not fall with distance. We are currently working to power implanted medical devices using these techniques.

<p><strong>WISP (Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform)</strong>

WISP, the Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform, is a family of sensors that are powered and read by UHF RFID readers. WISPs do not require batteries since they harvest their power from the RF signal generated by the reader. The WISP is an open source, open architecture EPC Class 1 Generation 2 RFID tag that includes a fully programmable 16 bit microcontroller, as well as arbitrary sensors. Unlike the WISP, conventional RFID tags are black boxes that cannot execute arbitrary computer programs, and do not support sensors. We have given WISPs to collaborators around the world. Many of the applications have been sensing related, but we were also surprised to find many applications in the areas of cryptography and security, enabled by WISPs programmability.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Touch Sensing with the Sea Shell Effect</strong>
<img src="/sensorlab/images/research/wisplink3.jpg" alt="" style="width: 150px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px" />
Seashell Effect Pre-Touch Sensing is a new form of sensing used to help robots sense the shape and material of objects before they grasp. ‚Äò‚ÄòPretouch‚Äô‚Äô refers to sensing modalities that are intermediate in range between tactile sensing and vision. The novel pretouch technique presented in this paper is effective on materials that prior pretouch techniques fail on. Seashell effect pretouch is inspired by the phenomenon of ‚Äò‚Äòhearing the sea‚Äô‚Äô when a seashell is held to the ear, and in particular relies on the observation that the ‚Äò‚Äòsound of the sea‚Äô‚Äô changes as the distance from the seashell to the head varies. To turn the familiar seashell effect into a sensor for robotic manipulation, a cavity and microphone was built into a robot finger. The sensor detects changes in the spectrum of ambient noise that occur when the finger approaches an object. Environmental noise is amplified most (attenuated least) at the cavity‚Äôs resonant frequency, which changes as the cavity approaches an object.</p>
