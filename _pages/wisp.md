# WISP (Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform)

## Summary

WISP, the Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform, is a family of sensors that are powered and read by UHF RFID readers. WISPs do not require batteries since they harvest their power from the RF signal generated by the reader. The WISP is an open source, open architecture EPC Class 1 Generation 2 RFID tag that includes a fully programmable 16 bit microcontroller, as well as arbitrary sensors. Unlike the WISP, conventional RFID tags are black boxes that cannot execute arbitrary computer programs, and do not support sensors. We have given WISPs to collaborators around the world. Many of the applications have been sensing related, but we were also surprised to find many applications in the areas of cryptography and security, enabled by WISPs programmability.

## NSF Support

The WISP project has been supported in part by grants from the National Science Foundation, including CNS-1823148 (“CRI:CI:SUSTAIN: Next-Generation, Sustainable Infrastructure for the RF-Powered Computing Community”),CNS-1305072 (“CI-ADDO-EN: Infrastructure for the RF-Powered Computing Community.”) Additional support from NSF Grant EEC-1028725, Intel Corporation, Disney Corporation, and the Google Faculty Research Awards program.

<p style="color:#0000FF;">Intellectual Merit</p>
The WISP infrastructure enables research in a number of areas. Over the years it has enabled a number of firsts, such as the first UHF-powered accelerometer input device and the first demonstration of public key cryptography on a wirelessly power device. Recent years have seen developments such as Ambient Backscatter Communication, and backscatter-based WISP cameras, which have been received with interest in the research community. Making these tools widely available will enable research on topics such as (ambient) backscatter networking, applications of battery-free cameras, and algorithms for interactive compression and computer vision in battery-free camera systems. This research would likely remain inaccessible for a long time to many CISE researchers, since there are no widely accessible platforms that support research on these topics. The sustained WISP infrastructure will also enable novel application research, in areas such as improved human activity detection systems, battery-free input devices, and also research on body-implanted electronics, and long term structural health monitoring.

<p style="color:#0000FF;">Broader Impacts</p>
Jeeva Inc is a company spun out of University of Washington that is commercializing research related to the WISP project. The magic of wireless power and backscatter communication can help attract students to science and engineering. We actively recruit students to participate in the research and we aim to increase the participation of students from under-represented groups.
