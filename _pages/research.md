**FREE-D: A Heart Pump Without a Cord**

The Free-range Resonant Electrical Energy Delivery (FREE-D) wireless power system uses magnetically coupled resonators to efficiently transfer power across meter distances to an artificial heart, specifically a ventricular assist device (VAD) implanted in the human body.  Previously, artificial heart pumps recieved power from a wire through the chest, limiting patient quality of life. In fact nearly 75% of the LVAD patient population experiences Exit Site Infection (ESI) within the first 6 months of implantation. The FREE-D system will cut down on cardiac patients' dangerous infections and improve quality of life.


**WREL(Wireless Resonant Energy Link)**

WREL enables transfer of large amounts of power (up to 50W) over medium distances (1m, depending on coil size). Our key contribution is the development of adaptive tuning techniques that enable high efficiency power transfer, even as transmit-receive range, orientation, or load vary. WIth most wireless power systems, the further the receiver is from the transmitter, the less power can be transferred. The WREL system has a "magic regime" in which efficiency does not fall with distance. We are currently working to power implanted medical devices using these techniques. Find out more about the FREE-D system, our wirelessly powered heart pump.
