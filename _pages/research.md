**FREE-D: A Heart Pump Without a Cord** 
![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/research/freed-vision.jpg){: style="width: 150px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px"}
The Free-range Resonant Electrical Energy Delivery (FREE-D) wireless power system uses magnetically coupled resonators to efficiently transfer power across meter distances to an artificial heart, specifically a ventricular assist device (VAD) implanted in the human body.  Previously, artificial heart pumps recieved power from a wire through the chest, limiting patient quality of life. In fact nearly 75% of the LVAD patient population experiences Exit Site Infection (ESI) within the first 6 months of implantation. The FREE-D system will cut down on cardiac patients' dangerous infections and improve quality of life.

**WREL(Wireless Resonant Energy Link)**

WREL enables transfer of large amounts of power (up to 50W) over medium distances (1m, depending on coil size). Our key contribution is the development of adaptive tuning techniques that enable high efficiency power transfer, even as transmit-receive range, orientation, or load vary. WIth most wireless power systems, the further the receiver is from the transmitter, the less power can be transferred. The WREL system has a "magic regime" in which efficiency does not fall with distance. We are currently working to power implanted medical devices using these techniques. Find out more about the FREE-D system, our wirelessly powered heart pump.

**WISP (Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform)**

WISP, the Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform, is a family of sensors that are powered and read by UHF RFID readers. WISPs do not require batteries since they harvest their power from the RF signal generated by the reader. The WISP is an open source, open architecture EPC Class 1 Generation 2 RFID tag that includes a fully programmable 16 bit microcontroller, as well as arbitrary sensors. Unlike the WISP, conventional RFID tags are black boxes that cannot execute arbitrary computer programs, and do not support sensors. We have given WISPs to collaborators around the world. Many of the applications have been sensing related, but we were also surprised to find many applications in the areas of cryptography and security, enabled by WISPs programmability.

**Pre-Touch Sensing with the Sea Shell Effect**
![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/research/pretouchlink1.jpg){: style="width: 150px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px"}
Seashell Effect Pre-Touch Sensing is a new form of sensing used to help robots sense the shape and material of objects before they grasp. ''Pretouch'' refers to sensing modalities that are intermediate in range between tactile sensing and vision. The novel pretouch technique presented in this paper is effective on materials that prior pretouch techniques fail on. Seashell effect pretouch is inspired by the phenomenon of ''hearing the sea'' when a seashell is held to the ear, and in particular relies on the observation that the ''sound of the sea'' changes as the distance from the seashell to the head varies. To turn the familiar seashell effect into a sensor for robotic manipulation, a cavity and microphone was built into a robot finger. The sensor detects changes in the spectrum of ambient noise that occur when the finger approaches an object. Environmental noise is amplified most (attenuated least) at the cavity's resonant frequency, which changes as the cavity approaches an object.

**Ambient Backscatter**

As computing devices become smaller and more numerous, powering them becomes more difficult; wires are often not feasible, and batteries add weight, bulk, cost, and require recharging/replacement that is impractical at large scales. Ambient backscatter communication solves this problem by leveraging existing TV and cellular transmissions, rather than generating their own radio waves. This novel technique enables ubiquitous communication where devices can communicate among themselves at unprecedented scales and in locations that were previously inaccessible.

**Brain Computer Interface for Robots**

We are been collaborating with the Neural Systems Lab to create a Brain Computer interface (BCI) for Hobbes (our PR2 robot), which will allow the robot to perform remote tasks. The system consists of our PR2 robot, an electrode cap for sensing brainwave frequencies, and graphical user interface for controlling the robot remotely. This system will allow a severely paralyzed patient to use a robot as a proxy to perform a task by issuings commands to the robot without the need of physical movement.

**Robotic Pile Sorting and Manipulation**
![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/research/PileSortingLink.jpg){: style="width: 150px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px"}
We are investigating strategies for robot interaction with piles of objects and materials in cluttered scenes. In particular, interaction with unstructured sets of objects will allow a robot to explore and manipulate novel items, in order to perform useful tasks such as counting, arranging, or sorting even without having a prior model of the objects.

**Deep Sea Wireless Power**

The Sensor Systems Lab is working with the UW Applied Physics Lab on underwater wireless power transfer and communication. We are collaborating with David Dyer and Bob Michimoto to transmit power wirelessly via WREL at 1000m depths beneath sea-level to charge power base stations. Tests have shown that the power transmission gain decreases in sea-water compared to air, and even fresh water. However, by modifying coil size and various parameters, this loss can be minimized. We have conducted tests to examine the effects that salt water and fresh water have on the wireless power transfer efficiency at both small signal levels, and at high power levels suitable for power transfer. The image shows a test tank for evaluating power transfer efficiency through seawater.
